# ⚡ Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Technique Visualizer

A real-time **gesture-controlled cursed technique visualizer** inspired by *Jujutsu Kaisen*.
This project uses **hand tracking + particle simulation** to recreate Gojo and Sukuna’s techniques directly in the browser using your webcam.

Built using **MediaPipe + Three.js**, this runs fully on the web — no installation needed.
